        <h1>Welcome to My Personal Website!</h1>

        <p class="text">Hi! I'm Xintong, a sophomore currently studying mathematics with interest in CS at Berkeley. I love animes, puzzles, "chill" video games and shopping, especially grocery shopping. I like things with logic and I like to explore the essence of something by going deeper with logic, and that's also how I deal with math and CS in general.</p>
